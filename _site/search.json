The course reviews some mathematical concepts most of you will be familiar with from high school, such as functions, derivatives, integrals, vectors, matrices and probability distributions. Each day consists of lectures and exercise sessions. The course’s objective is to make students familiar and comfortable with notation, reading mathematical statements, and applying various mathematical techniques."
